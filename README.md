## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github! I'm JiHye, a solutions and detail-oriented full stack software engineer pivoting from eight years of experience in community pharmacy. Coding is so fun! Here is a little list of some of my favorite projects. 

## Projects âš¡

### Friender 
- Flask/Python backend, jinja/WTForms front end
- In a cool, retro, Windows 95 style, this web-based application allows authenticated users to upload a profile photo that will be stored on AWS S3, swipe on users within a certain radius, and once matched (if there is a right swipe from each user, they've matched!) there is functionality to send and receive messages from their new friend.

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.
Profile Management: Users can create and edit profiles, including uploading profile photos stored on AWS S3.
Friend Matching: Swipe functionality to accept or decline potential friends based on geographical proximity (utilizes the Zip Code API to determine distance based on zip code).
Messaging: Once matched, users can send and receive messages with their new friends, enhancing the social connection.
