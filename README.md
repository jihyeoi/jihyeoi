## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github! I'm JiHye, a solutions and detail-oriented full stack software engineer pivoting from eight years of experience in community pharmacy. Coding is so fun! Here is a little list of some of my favorite projects. 

## Projects âš¡

### Friender 
- Flask/Python backend, jinja/WTForms front end
- In a cool, retro, Windows 95 style, this web-based application allows authenticated users to upload a profile photo that will be stored on AWS S3, swipe on users within a certain radius, and once matched (if there is a right swipe from each user, they've matched!) there is functionality to send and receive messages from their new friend. 
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/jihyeoi/friender-python)

### Jobly
- full-stack application built with React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend
- Authenticated users can view a list of companies / search for a specific company, and click into them for company-specific jobs. Once they find a job they like, they can apply for it, and see the list of their applied jobs. Loved diving deeper and playing around with all the modularity that came with reusable components via React!

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning **Next.js** and using it to build a project called **Where's my Wegovy**, a user-driven app to help patients find pharmacy locations that have Wegovy in stock. This project was inspired by the many calls I've received at the pharmacy regarding its availability - the drug has been on backorder for over a year!
